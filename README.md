## Available Scripts

You will need to run npm i and make sure all the dependencies are installed . The external libs used are :
React  
 Amcharts 4
Devextreme React (latest version)
Intro JS (React version)

Don't forget to add the --save option (if you're still using npm < 5)

Make sure you use a port other than 3000 because the backend uses that in this example.
You can also change the receiving URL under App.js called endpoint: "http://localhost:3000"
